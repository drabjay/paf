## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'paf'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install paf

## Usage

May be used to format the PAF elements as an array of strings:

```ruby
Paf.format(
  building_name: '1-2',
  thoroughfare_name: 'NURSERY',
  thoroughfare_descriptor: 'LANE',
  dependent_locality: 'PENN',
  post_town: 'HIGH WYCOMBE',
  postcode: 'HP10 8LS'
)

['1-2 NURSERY LANE', 'PENN', 'HIGH WYCOMBE', 'HP10 8LS']
```

Or as a single string:

```ruby
Paf.to_s(
  building_name: '1-2',
  thoroughfare_name: 'NURSERY',
  thoroughfare_descriptor: 'LANE',
  dependent_locality: 'PENN',
  post_town: 'HIGH WYCOMBE',
  postcode: 'HP10 8LS'
)

'1-2 NURSERY LANE, PENN, HIGH WYCOMBE. HP10 8LS'
```

Or from a Paf instance:

```ruby
paf = Paf.new(
  building_name: '1-2',
  thoroughfare_name: 'NURSERY',
  thoroughfare_descriptor: 'LANE',
  dependent_locality: 'PENN',
  post_town: 'HIGH WYCOMBE',
  postcode: 'HP10 8LS'
)
paf.format

['1-2 NURSERY LANE', 'PENN', 'HIGH WYCOMBE', 'HP10 8LS']

paf = Paf.new(
  building_name: '1-2',
  thoroughfare_name: 'NURSERY',
  thoroughfare_descriptor: 'LANE',
  dependent_locality: 'PENN',
  post_town: 'HIGH WYCOMBE',
  postcode: 'HP10 8LS'
)
paf.to_s

'1-2 NURSERY LANE, PENN, HIGH WYCOMBE. HP10 8LS'
```
